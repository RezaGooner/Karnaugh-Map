is a graphical user interface (GUI) program that uses Karnaugh-Map for visualization and minimization. Karnaugh-Map is a conventional method for visualizing and reducing logical expressions in algebraic logic. This method is used to simplify and analyze logical expressions and is especially used in the design and analysis of digital systems.

Using this program, you can enter your logic expressions and display them graphically using Karnaugh-Map and then reduce them. The program is written in Python and C++.

Karnaugh-Map display: The program is able to display logical expressions in Karnaugh-Map format. Karnaugh-Map is a two-dimensional diagram in which the inputs and outputs of a logic statement are placed in the form of a table.

Reduction of logical expressions: Using Karnaugh-Map, the program is able to reduce logical expressions. This reduction is used to simplify expressions and reduce the number of inputs and outputs.

Program features: The program has a graphical user interface that allows the user to easily enter logical expressions and view the results in the Karnaugh-Map. With the help of arranged objects on the page, it can do the following:
1. Determining the number of necessary variables and their symbols for the logical expression
2. Display the correct table
3. Minimize and convert to Pos and vice versa
4. The possibility of including dontcares
5. Automatic counting of minterms, literals and terms, dontcares
6. Ability to save results
7. Display groupings in a form (by drawing colored circles) and also display in text form
8. arrangement tooltip for each minterm with necessary explanations about it



Programming languages support: The program is written in Python and C++ programming languages. This allows you to easily develop the application and make necessary changes.
